hotkeyTip=You can choose a hotkey file to use for the WololoKingdoms Mod. You have three options\n1) Use current AoC/Voobly hotkeys: This looks for a player1.hki file in your AoE2 installation folder, which is what would be used when playing standard AoC via Voobly. If it can't find such a file, it will use the default AoC hotkeys\n2) Use HD hotkeys for this mod only: This looks for a player0.hki file in your HD installation folder and uses those for the WololoKingdoms mod\n3) Use HD hotkeys for this mod and AoC: Same as 2), but this will use your current HD hotkeys for standard AoC via Voobly as well and overwrite your current ones\n\nIf you've run this installer before, you'll also get an option to keep the current hotkey setup.
tooltipTip=This replaces the tooltips of units, technologies and buildings that are shown in the tech tree or in-game with extended help (F1) enabled<br \>It provides some error corrections, and more information such as research/creation time, attack speed, attack boni and more<br \>This is available as a mod for Voobly, selecting the checkbox will make it permanent (and available offline as well)<br \>To remove it, you'll need to run the installer again with this checkbox unchecked.
modsTip=You can choose from the most common graphical mods to make them permanent (and available offline as well)\nTo remove the mods, you'll need to run the installer again with the checkboxes unchecked.
exeTip=This creates a WK.exe in your <folder> folder that can be used for playing WololoKingdoms without Voobly\nWhen checked an extra window for the Userpatch will open during the installation. Choose the options you want, run it, and then close it.
